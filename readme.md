# Advent of Code 2025

I am writing this code in [DLang](https://dlang.org/), which I have recently
become addicted to.

Each day has its own Readme file that summarizes the solution.

All the code generally expects a `input.txt` file with the puzzle input.

The code in this repository, if you wanted to use it for whatever reason, is
licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.

Git commits are more of a "when I think I should commit" so the dates do not
line up with the Advent of Code days.
