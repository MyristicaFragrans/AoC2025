# Advent of Code 2025 Day 2 Parts 1 & 2

https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/2

First I spent 20 minutes in utter confusion before seeing the word ["range"](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1pc91m1/2025_day_2_seeing_lots_of_posts_like_this/)
to describe the numbers.

Here, I used a naïve brute-force method, not reading Reddit until getting the
correct answer. For part 1, I just check at index 0 and index length/2 and treat
them as seperate strings to compare.

In part 2, I do about the same thing, but for an arbitrary number of common
denominators (also found through brute force).

Now please see a better solution [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1pc14d1/2025_day_2_when_i_realized_the_solution_i_felt/)
